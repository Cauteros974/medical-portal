                To help a child with seasonal allergies, manage their environment by keeping windows closed, 
                using air conditioning, and showering after outdoor play to wash off allergens. Also, consult 
                a healthcare provider about medications, such as antihistamines, and consider strategies like 
                using air purifiers with HEPA filters or wearing a mask outdoors during high pollen counts.

        <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms </h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Common symptoms</strong> include sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, watery and itchy eyes, and an itchy or scratchy throat.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Distinguish from a cold:</strong> An itchiness in the mouth or throat is more common with allergies than a cold.
