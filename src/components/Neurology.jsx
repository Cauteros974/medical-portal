                Getting enough sleep is crucial for your physical and mental health because it supports the body's repair processes, 
                strengthens the immune system, and helps maintain a healthy weight and balanced mood. Quality sleep enhances cognitive 
                functions like memory and focus, reduces stress, lowers the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes,
                and improves overall alertness and well-being.
