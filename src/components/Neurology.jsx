                Getting enough sleep is crucial for your physical and mental health because it supports the body's repair processes, 
                strengthens the immune system, and helps maintain a healthy weight and balanced mood. Quality sleep enhances cognitive 
                functions like memory and focus, reduces stress, lowers the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes,
                and improves overall alertness and well-being.

                cytokines and other substances that fight infection and inflammation, making 
                you less likely to get sick

                2.Maintains a Healthy Weight Sufficient sleep helps regulate hormones that control 
                appetite, and people who sleep enough tend to consume fewer calories and have more 
                motivation to exercise.

                helping to reduce stress, irritability, and mood swings, and improving your overall
